# Project_SEAI_25
**Description** 

Project for the Symbolic and Evolutionary Artificial Intelligence exam of the AIDE master's degree at the University of Pisa, year 2024-2025.

The project involves training a neural network to recognize voice commands that will be used to remotely control a television or MP3 player.
The goal of the project is to train the neural network on a dataset of audio files containing single words, with different pronunciations.
Among these words, the main command words (Start, Stop, Pause, Forward, Backward) must be recognized, while the other words related to other commands must be ignored.
Once trained, the neural network will be placed in an FPGA.
